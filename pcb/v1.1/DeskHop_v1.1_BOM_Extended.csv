Assembly Notes:
1. PCB Thickness: 1.6mm (required for proper case fit)
2. U4 Alternative: ADuM1201BRZ can be used instead of ISO7721DR (pin-compatible but more expensive)
3. All SMD components are on the top side of the PCB
4. Ensure proper orientation of U3, U4, U5 (pin 1 markers)
5. The Raspberry Pi Picos should be soldered with headers facing down (USB connectors accessible)
6. J2 and J3 are for optional debug/UART connections
7. Clean flux residue after assembly to prevent corrosion
